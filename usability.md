# Usability

Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. It is usually thought as decomposable further in more precise qualities: 

#### Learnability
How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?

#### Efficiency
Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?

#### Memorability
When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

#### Absence of Errors
How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?

#### Satisfaction
How pleasant is the use of the design?


## Heuristics

One of the most popular series of heuristics are Jakob Nielsen’s, published in 1994 in the book “Usability Inspection Methods” by Jakob Nielsen and Robert L. Mack. They were a refinemend of an earlier set of heuristics by Nielsen and Molich --  a danish IDer. Molich maintains a list of the Nielsen heuristics with examples that is very clear and easy to read [Molich].

1. [Visibility of system status](./usability_examples/status.md)
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation
