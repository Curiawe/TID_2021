## Components of usability

#### Learnability
How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?

#### Efficiency
Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?

#### Memorability
When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

#### Absence of Errors
How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?

#### Satisfaction
How pleasant is the use of the design?
