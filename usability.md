# Usability

Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. It is usually thought as decomposable further in more precise qualities: 

#### Learnability
How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?

#### Efficiency
Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?

#### Memorability
When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

#### Absence of Errors
How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?

#### Satisfaction
How pleasant is the use of the design?


## Heuristics

One of the most popular series of heuristics are Jakob Nielsen’s, published in 1994 in the book “Usability Inspection Methods” by Jakob Nielsen and Robert L. Mack. They were a refinemend of an earlier set of heuristics by Nielsen and Molich --  a danish IDer. Molich maintains a list of the Nielsen heuristics with examples that is very clear and easy to read [Molich].

2. [Match between system and the real world](./usability_examples/2_match.md)
3. [User control and freedom](./usability_examples/3_control.md)
4. [Consistency and standards](./usability_examples/4_consistency.md)
5. [Error prevention](./usability_examples/5_error.md)
6. [Recognition rather than recall](./usability_examples/6_recognition.md)
7. [Flexibility and efficiency of use](./usability_examples/7_flexibility.md)
8. [Aesthetic and minimalist design](./usability_examples/8_aesthetics.md)
9. [Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors](./usability_examples/9_help.md)
10. [Help and documentation](./usability_examples/10_documentation.md)
