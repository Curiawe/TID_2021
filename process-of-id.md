# The Process of Interaction Design

> ID is the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. (*Alan Cooper, About Face*)

> Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in everyday and working lives. (*Preece et. al, Interaction Design*)

It is a creative process, and like any creative process, it has to be developed

- with a given set of constratins and 
- in an iterative manner

Unlike other disciplines it is focused as much on *behavior* as on form.

As you can imagine, based on this definition, interaction design is a very broad domain. 

> Personal Story: There are conferences that cover the topic: e.g. CHI -- the main international conference where researchers working in human-computer interaction meet to discuss the latest findings. At one of the last such conferences I attended the topics ranged from: smart shoes, to smart pills, to 5D games, to adaptable systems for language learning (this was my presentation). 

#### It's not easy to design a new successful behavior
Every year an incredible large number of products is created, and only a few of them are successful. So what makes some products more successful than others? Think about:
 
 - how many games do you have installed on your phone? how many games are out there?
 - how many music players were there before iPod. how many after?
 - how many products did google have? How many are discontinued? (https://killedbygoogle.com/)
 - how many startups set up to disrupt and revolutionize the world? how many actually do this? 

*Gedankenexperiment:* Think about a TODO list app. There must be thousands of such apps. Why do we only use a few? And we still hear about only a few (Todoist, RememberTheMilk). There is a very large design space. With many dimensions. And many of the points in that space are unsuccessful. 


Now this does not mean that it's impossible. it just means that it is hard. And if we think about what the successful products, they usually solve a problem. They offer us value. And then, in the category where there are many products that offer the same value, the ones that are more simple to use, or more pleasant to use, are preferred. 

Thus, we introduce the distinction between: *usefulness* and *usability* [Laundauer, 95]: 

* **usefulness** = value. To have something that is useful it requires understanding humans; and understanding their problems; their specific problems; and making sure that you fit in their workflow; and it is more important than usable; but it's also harder;

* **usability** means that the digital artifact is pleasant; and easy to use; not cumbersome; and not annoying to the user; and positive emotions in the user [Emotional Design, D. Norman]; some people consider usability to be an [excavator of usefulness](https://bitzesty.com/2014/05/15/usability-and-usefulness-in-ux-web-design/).

Note that sometimes, usability is just a nice to have thing; and other times it's a matter of life and death. The story of the [car gear shifter in which the state was not visible](https://uxdesign.cc/the-usability-issue-that-caused-1-death-and-38-injuries-97911dfa5c7f
). The low usabilty of the plane that lead to the [death of John Denver](https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NTSB_Determines_John_Denvers_Crash_Caused_by_Poor_Placement_of_Fuel_Selector_Handle_Diverting_His_Attention_During_Flight.aspx).  



It seems that delivering something useful and usable are both important. But how to do that? 


## ID Processes 
So you can imagine why many people would try to provide recipes for how to do Interaction Design the right way TM. And indeed, there are many processes for ID. 



 - Design Thinking [DT] - ideology asserts that a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem solving can lead to innovation. Process comprises 6 distinct phases. 

 - Google Design Sprints [GDS] - Process from ideation to prototyping and evaluation; without implementation. 

 - The Double Diamond Model - process model created by Design Council, a British organization, in 2005. Four main stages across two adjacent diamonds. Discovering the problem is an important part. 


Guess what? All of them have a few things in common. The most important, they are all iterative. Also, the process will always have several *kinds* of activities: 

 - requirements - understanding the users and the problem
 - alternatives - getting creative; brainstorming
 - prototyping - trying out stuff as cheaply as possible
 - evaluating - getting feedback from representative users; observing them

 
Finally, most processes will make a distinction between phases in which one searches for solution and phases in which these solutions are reduced and evaluated. 

Different approaches put different emphasis on the different kinds of phases but all the phases are important. In every phase, there are different kinds of activities.
